  patch - files under patch/ is for kernel and ONIE installer                 
        for the kernel:         
            config-accton-as7712_32x.patch 
                    for kernel configuration.
            driver-i2c-muxes-pca954x-always-deselect.patch 
                    for i2c_mux deselects after transaction.
            driver-net-ethernet-intel-igb-v5.2.15.patch 
                    for management port to work.
            driver-patches-for-accton-as7712-fan-psu-cpld.patch
                    for as7712's fan/psu/cpld/led
        for ONIE:
            onie_installer-accton-AS7712-32X.patch 
                    for console port setting and copy util to rootfs.            
  module - Contains source for kernel driver modules. 


To build a kernel that supports docker, do as following steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/Azure/sonic-linux-kernel
2. Copy patches and series under patch/ to sonic-linux-kernel/patch.
3. Run ./build.sh

After kernel is built, goes to sonic-buildimage to pack it to ONIE installer.
1. git clone https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage    
2. Run ./get_deps.sh and git submodule update --init --recursive
3. Copy the output .deb file from sonic-linux-kernel into ./deps
4. Change console setting for AS7712-32X by patching build_image.sh.
    patch -p1 < onie_installer-accton-AS7712-32X.patch
5. Before start building installer, suggest you change to a docker environment.
   For the build needs to be root and it flush the docker daemon.
   Check sonic-buildimage/README.md for more details.
6. ./build_debian.sh "admin" "$(perl -e 'print crypt("YourPaSsWoRd", "salt"),"\n"')"
7. ./build_image.sh.
   This may fail due to file changed by patching at step 4.
   You may consider to comment out the "git status" checking at build_image.sh.
8. After successful built, the ONIE installer, "acs-generic.bin", is generated.

All Linux kernel code is licensed under the GPLv1. All other code is

The code for interacting with Accton AS7712-32X has 2 parts, 
kernel drivers and operational script. 
The kernel drivers of peripherals are under module/ directory.
1.  These drivers are patched into kernel by 
    driver-patches-for-accton-as7712-fan-psu-cpld.patcha
    Or your can build the driver under module/ by setting environment variable, 
    KERNEL_SRC, to proper linux built directory and run make. 
    It may be sonic-linux-kernel/linux-3.*/debian/build/build_amd64_none_amd64/.
2.  A operational script, accton_as7712_util.py, for device initializatian and 
    peripheral accessing, should be installed at /usr/bin. 
    It's done by patching onie_installer-accton-AS7712-32X.patch at build-image.
    Run "accton_as7712_util.py install" to install drivers.

To initialize the system, run "accton_as7712_util.py install".
To clean up the drivers & devices, run "accton_as7712_util.py clean".
To dump information of sensors, run "accton_as7712_util.py show".
To dump SFP EEPROM, run "accton_as7712_util.py sff".
To set fan speed, run "accton_as7712_util.py set fan".
To enable/disable SFP emission, run "accton_as7712_util.py set sfp".
To set system LEDs' color, run "accton_as7712_util.py set led"
For more information, run "accton_as7712_util.py --help".

====================================================================
Besides applying accton_as7712_util.py to access peripherals, you can 
access peripherals by sysfs nodes directly after the installation is run.

LED controls can be found under /sys/class/leds. The sysfs interface
color mappings are as follows:
Brightness:
  0 => off
  1 => green
  2 => amber
  3 => red
  4 => blue

There are 5 system LEDs, loc, diag, fan, ps1, and ps2. 
They are lit automatically by CPLD, but the loc and diag.
The loc led has only 1 color, blue.
The diag one has 3 colors: red, amber, and green.

Fan controls can be found in /sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066.
There are 12 fans inside 6 fan modules.
All fans share 1 duty setting, ranged from 0~100.

Three temperature sensors are controlled by the lm75 kernel modules. 
They should already be visible under /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/lm75/.

Two power supplies are controlled by the CPLD. 
Here provide their status under
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/10-0050 and /sys/bus/i2c/devices/11-0053.

There are 32 QSFP+ modules are equipped. 
Apply "accton_as7712_util.py show" to get their status. 
Apply "accton_as7712_util.py set sfp" to turn on/off light transmission.
Apply "accton_as7712_util.py sff" to dump EEPROM information.
Before operating on that QSFP+, please make sure it is well plugged. 
Otherwise, operation is going to fail.
